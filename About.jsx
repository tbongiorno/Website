                Thank you for visiting my website. This website will be 
                used to store my projects as I develop new skills in 
                several areas of Computer Science. These projects will
                range from websites made with React(like this one) to 
                video games created using Godot. I don't know what I 
                will be making in the future but I hope you take the 
                time to look through everything.

                My name is Thomas Bongiorno and as of writing this 
                I am a Sophomore at Virginia Tech majoring in Computer 
                Science. I recently came to 2 seperate realizations
                about my future. The first is that I don't really 
                know what I want to do with Computer Science. I 
                know this is the generaly area I want to study and 
                I like what I have done in my CS classes but I never 
                took the time to dive deep into each of the areas of 
                CS to discover what I really like to do. 
                This fed into the next realization that I am not as 
                skilled at programming as I should be. CS majors that 
                I live next to and am friends with are all able to 
                create many different things that I don't have the 
                base knowledge to even start.
